PHP-Nuke: Web Portal System
===========================

- How to support PHP-Nuke project?

    I made this software free, and released it under GPL, so this software
costs you exactly "nothing". All that I ask you is, if you use it "please"
leave the copyright messages on the generated pages so others can know that
you're using PHP-Nuke. This copyright notices are required and can't be removed
or edited in any way. To know why you should leave the notices in place refer to
the Section 2(c) of the GPL license. That's all I ask.
    If for any reason you want to have my written authorization to remove all
and any copyright notice shown on generated pages, go to the URL:

    http://phpnuke.org/modules.php?name=Commercial_License

    If you want to make a contribution you can just purchase the latest version
before it goes public for free. With this you can have it before anyone else and
costs only $10. You can purchase it from:

    http://phpnuke.org/modules.php?name=Release

    Another method to support PHP-Nuke's development is by signing up to PHP-Nuke
Club. For US$ 100/year you will help me, and at the same time you'll receive
special access to any PHP-Nuke development versions (Alphas, Betas and Release
Candidates) not available to the public, you can download the final official
releases before it goes released to the public, and some other cool stuff.
    To access the Club and see what you can get, point your browser to:
    
    http://phpnuke.org/modules.php?name=Club

    Finally, if you use PHP-Nuke in your site, please let me know and I'll put
a link back to your site from mine in the PHP-Nuke page. For this please use the
"Submit News" link on the main page. Ok?

    Enjoy this software!
